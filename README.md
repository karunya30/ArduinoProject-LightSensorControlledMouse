# Arduino Project-Light Sensor Controlled Mousee
Using the sensors in an Arduino kit to create a device that moves the mouse on the screen. 

## What does it do? 
- The mouse is controlled by a light sensor. If it moves closer to a light source and detects more light, the mouse will then move towards the right, vice versa. 
- The button is then pressed to change the direction in which the mouse is moving at.
- The mouse can then move around the desktop and click on an application and this application will open up. 
- In this case, the application that opens up is one that graphs the amount of light being read by the light sensor on the Arduino board in real time.
